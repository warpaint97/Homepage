			<h2>Quality Content<hr></h2>
			<p>
				This is the place to find quality content.<br>
				I have nothing to say. But I will say it anyway as means of filling this webpage with lots of irrelevant text.
				Therefore, I shall continue with my prattling of the lowest order whether thou desire it or not.
				As a quick reminder, in the unlikely scenario of a sudden loss of memory, I will allow myself to repeat the latter statement of utter nonsensical nature.
				Perhaps the reader of this magical webpage expects me to repeat previous information.
				But surprisingly I must first ask what it is that thou expect me to say.
				You are not accusing me of being a forgetful individual of minimal cognitive capacity, are thou?
				Nevertheless, without further ado, let us begin the ritual at this instance.
				Therefore, I shall continue with my prattling of the lowest order whether thou desire it or not.
				Mission completed at last. May the reader rest in peace as the author of this enchanting sequence of roman characters lives happily ever after.<br>
				Farewell!
